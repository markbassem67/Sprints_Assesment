# 🛒  Sprints Assesment 

A fully functional **Shopping Mobile Application** built with **Flutter** and **Dart**, developed as part of the **Sprints Assessment Final Project**.  


## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of mobile app development with Flutter — from Dart fundamentals to advanced UI, navigation, and localization.  

The app includes:
- A beautiful **welcome screen** with local and online images, styled text, and navigation buttons.  
- **Sign Up / Sign In** forms with validation and success dialogs.  
- **Smooth animated transitions** between pages.  
- A **Shopping Home Screen** with featured products, a responsive product grid, and hot offers.  
- **SnackBar feedback** for cart actions.  

This project is designed to simulate real-world mobile development workflows, emphasising **clean code**, **reusability**, and **best practices**.
